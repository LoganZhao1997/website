## An End-to-End Machine Learning Approach for Vechile Sharing System Operations
*Columbia University, Jun. 2021 ~ Dec. 2021*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Sharon Di](https://www.civil.columbia.edu/faculty/sharon-di)

- Developed a shared fleet simulation environment leveraging the historical taxi data in New York for testing different management strategies
- Proposed a learning-based approach that embeds a graph convolutional neural network model into a local search algorithm to learn the matching policy in the vehicle sharing operations
- Designed a novel training method that ensembles imitation learning and evolutionary strategy; Trained the model to imitate the Blossom algorithm first and self-evolute by interacting with the environment
- Conducted a series of experiments and showed that the proposed method outperformed the traditional heuristic algorithm in terms of customer satisfaction and computation efficiency

## Optimized Energy-Spong Electric Vehicle Sharing System with Integration of Renewable Energy
*Remote, Jul. 2020 ~ Mar. 2021*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/)  
Collaborator: Yikang Hua  

- Proposed a robust and stochastic optimization model for a spatially distributed electric vehicle fleet w renewable energy integrated to serve as a backup reservation interfacing with transportation and power grid system
- Developed a data-driven approach for constructing uncertainty set in robust optimization to deal with the temporal-spatial correlation in uncertain renewable energy generation and avoid over-conservative
- Proved that the above robust and stochastic optimization model under correlated uncertainty can be linearized by adding auxiliary variables and extra constraints

## Energy-Sponge Electric Vehicle Sharing System Design
*University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 2019 ~ Jan. 2020*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/)  
Collaborator: Yikang Hua  

- Established a profit-driven planning framework for electric vehicle sharing system to optimize its strategies in energy bidding, serving customers, charging, and relocation
- Implemented a two-stage stochastic model for electric vehicle sharing management incorporating the uncertainty of customer demand in spatiality, temporality, and quantity
- Built and solved the stochastic model via Python and Gurobi; Conducted a case study in Austin to demonstrate the managerial insights

## Design Optimization of Composite Wind Turbine Blades
*Zhejiang University, Sept. 2018 ~ Apr. 2019*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Weifei Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018087/)

- Modeled both the lightning strike dielectric breakdown failure and multi-axial fatigue failure mechanisms for the structural design of composite wind turbine blades
- Proposed a design optimization framework that integrates realistic lightning strike electrostatic and fatigue analyses for designing reliable and economical composite wind turbine blades
- Conducted a case study of the structural design optimization of a 5â€‰MW composite wind turbine blade using the framework with two optimization solvers: sequential quadratic programming and Bayesian optimization
