## Energy-Sponge Electric Vehicle Sharing System Design

The rising prevalence of Electric Vehicles (EVs) raises an opportunity to create a new vehicle sharing service where a spatially-distributed EV fleet serves as a backup reservation interfacing with both the transportation and power grid systems. While this “energy sponge” service is promising to mitigate demand disturbances and improve system resilience, its implementation requires overcoming several critical challenges under the perspective of power grid limitations and complicated vehicle management. To this end, we establish a profit-driven planning framework to provide systematic management strategies for such an EV sharing system. In particular, we build a two-stage stochastic model to generate sustainable management strategies considering the stochastic spatiotemporal fluctuations of the requests for this new service. In our model, the bid process of an EV fleet operator in the day-ahead energy and reserve market constitutes the first stage, which is optimized based upon macroscopic modeling on the next-day operations of the EV fleet as the second stage. Interesting managerial insights on bid strategies are obtained through numerical experiments.
