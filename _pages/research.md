## Optimized Energy-Spong Electric Vehicle Sharing System with Integration of Renewable Energy
*Remote, Jul 2020 ~ Apr 2021*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/)  
Collaborator: Yikang Hua  
* Proposed a stochastic model to integrate spattio-temporally fluctuant and correlated renewable energy sources into the electric vehicle sharing system 
* Established an optimzation framework combining stochastic programming and adjusted robust optimization with correlation to solve the model


## Energy-Sponge Electric Vehicle Sharing System Design
*University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 2019 ~ May 2020*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/)  
Collaborator: Yikang Hua  

* Implemented a two-stage stochastic model to simulate the daily operation of the electric vehicle sharing system and its interaction with the power grid and deal with the temporal-spatial uncertainty of passenger order demand
* Solved the model via L-shape method, sample average approxmiation using Gurobi and conducted a sophisticated real case study for the vehilce sharing system in Austin
* Presented the results in *Transportation Research Board 2021* **(Post)** [POST](http://www.wentaozhao.org/files/TRB2021_post.pdf)

## Design Optimization of Composite Wind Turbine Blades
*Zhejiang University, Sep 2018 ~ Apr 2019*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Weifei Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018087/)

* Modeled both the lightning strike dielectric breakdown failure and multi-axial fatigue failure mechanisms for structural design of composite wind turbine blades
* Proposed a design optimization framework which integrates realistic lightning strike electrostatic and fatigue analyses for designing reliable and economical composite wind turbine blades
* Conducted a case study of the structural design optimization of a 5â€‰MW composite wind turbine blade using the framework with two optimization solvers: sequential quadratic programming and Bayesian optimization 
* First paper published in *North America Wind Energy Academy WindTech 2019 Conference* **(Presentation)** [PPT](http://www.wentaozhao.org/files/NAWEA_ppt.pdf) [doi](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1452/1/012049) 
* Second paper published in *Engineering Optimization* [doi](https://doi.org/10.1080/0305215X.2019.1690649)
