## An End-to-End Machine Learning Approach for Vechile Sharing Operation
*Columbia University, Jun 2021 ~ Dec 2021*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Sharon Di](https://www.civil.columbia.edu/faculty/sharon-di)

- Developed a learning-based approach for managing carpooling, order-vehicle matching, and idle vehicle relocation in the vehicle sharing system
- Proposed an adaptive matching strategy including the application of graph convolutional neural network with guided search algorithm and a training approach that ensembles imitation learning and evolutionary strategy
- Conducted a series of experiments and showed that the proposed method outperformed the traditional heuristic algorithm in terms of customer satisfaction and computation efficiency

## Optimized Energy-Spong Electric Vehicle Sharing System with Integration of Renewable Energy
*Remote, Jul 2020 ~ Apr 2021*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/)  
Collaborator: Yikang Hua  

- Proposed a robust optimization model for scheduling charging and daily operations of electric vehicle sharing system with renewable energy integrated
- Designed a data-driven approach for dealing with renewable energy's temporal-spatial correlation and distribution uncertainty
- Proved that the budget-constrained adjustable robust optimization under correlated uncertainty can be linearized by adding auxiliary variables and extra constraints

## Energy-Sponge Electric Vehicle Sharing System Design
*University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 2019 ~ May 2020*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/)  
Collaborator: Yikang Hua  

- Implemented a two-stage stochastic model to simulate the daily operation of the shared electric vehicle fleet and its interaction with the power grid
- Developed an optimization approach that incorporates the temporal-spatial uncertainty of passenger order demand
- Solved the model via the combination of the L-shape method and the sample average approximation method using Gurobi

## Design Optimization of Composite Wind Turbine Blades
*Zhejiang University, Sep 2018 ~ Apr 2019*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Weifei Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018087/)

- Modeled both the lightning strike dielectric breakdown failure and multi-axial fatigue failure mechanisms for the structural design of composite wind turbine blades
- Proposed a design optimization framework that integrates realistic lightning strike electrostatic and fatigue analyses for designing reliable and economical composite wind turbine blades
- Conducted a case study of the structural design optimization of a 5â€‰MW composite wind turbine blade using the framework with two optimization solvers: sequential quadratic programming and Bayesian optimization
