The rising prevalence of Electric Vehicles (EVs) raises an opportunity to create a new vehicle sharing service where a spatially-distributed EV fleet serves as a backup reservation interfacing with both the transportation and power grid systems. While this “energy sponge” service is promising to mitigate demand disturbances and improve system resilience, its implementation requires overcoming several critical challenges under the perspective of power grid limitations and complicated vehicle management. To this end, we establish a profit-driven planning framework to provide systematic management strategies for such an EV sharing system. In particular, we build a two-stage stochastic model to generate sustainable management strategies considering the stochastic spatiotemporal fluctuations of the requests for this new service. In our model, the bid process of an EV fleet operator in the day-ahead energy and reserve market constitutes the first stage, which is optimized based upon macroscopic modeling on the next-day operations of the EV fleet as the second stage. Interesting managerial insights on bid strategies are obtained through numerical experiments.

## Design Optimization of Composite Wind Turbine Blades
*Zhejiang University, Sep 2018 ~ Apr 2019*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Weifei Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018087/)

We presents a design optimization framework which integrates realistic lightning strike electrostatic and fatigue analyses for designing reliable and economical composite wind turbine blades. The novel aspects of this work include: a parametric tortuous lightning stepped leader model that reflects one of the true natural characteristics of the lightning phenomenon; and characterization of both the lightning strike dielectric breakdown failure and multi-axial fatigue failure mechanisms for structural design of composite wind turbine blades. A case study of the structural design optimization of a 5 MW composite wind turbine blade is tested using the framework with two optimization solvers: sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and Bayesian optimization (BO). SQP produces a superior optimal design to BO. In the optimum blade design based on the SQP algorithm, the lightning safety ratio increased by 32% and the expected fatigue life increased more than 15 times compared with the initial blade design.
