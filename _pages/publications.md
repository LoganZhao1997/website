## Energy-Sponge Electric Vehicle Sharing System Design
*University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 2019 ~ May 2021*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/)  
Co-worker: Yikang Hua  
* Proposed a novel cooperative scheme between an electric vehicle sharing company and local power grid which could increase the regional power systemâ€™s reliability and save over 15% on electric energy costs.
* Developed a two-stage economic operation framework for the vehicle sharing company and provided the operator with a stochastic approach to deal with the uncertainty dictated by the fluctuations of market demand.
* Solved the model via L-shaped method based on Bender Decomposition using Gurobi, conducted several numerical studies, for instance, sensitivity analysis, and a real case study to validate its economic benefits.

## Design Optimization of Composite Wind Turbine Blades
*Zhejiang University, Sep 2018 ~ Apr 2019*  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Weifei Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018087)

Co-worker: [Prof. Yeqing Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=neVf4uIAAAAJ&hl=en)  
* Modeled and estimated the occurrence of dielectric breakdown damage on the surface of wind turbine blades.
* Co-designed an optimization framework integrating realistic lightning strike electrostatic and fatigue analyses as a means to design reliable and economical composite wind turbine blades.
* Applied the optimization framework for a composite wind turbine using sequential-quadratic-programming and Bayesian optimization, achieving an increase in the lightning safety ratio by 32% and the expected fatigue life by more than 1500%.
