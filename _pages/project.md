## [Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization](https://www.ecole.ai/2021/ml4co-competition/)
NeurIPS 2021 Competition, Jun 2021 ~ Oct 2021<br> 
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Shipra Agrawa](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/shipra-agrawal)<br> 
Collaborator: Abhi Gupta

- Improved the branch-and-bound algorithm by replacing the heuristic branching policy with graph convolutional neural network
- Developed a training method in a combination of behavior cloning and parallel evolutionary algorithm
- Designed and built a Singularity container for running and evaluating algorithms on the high-performance computing cluster

## [Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge](https://routingchallenge.mit.edu/)
Amazon & MIT Research Challenge, Mar 2021 ~ Jun 2021<br>  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Sharon Di](https://www.civil.columbia.edu/faculty/sharon-di)<br>
Collaborator: Chen Jing, Yunhao Xing

- Realized an attention model in the Transformer architecture for route optimization problems under realistically sized problem instances
- Trained the model via reinforcement learning and imitation learning; Conducted experiments to compare these training methods<br>
