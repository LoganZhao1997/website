## [Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization](https://www.ecole.ai/2021/ml4co-competition/)
NeurIPS 2021 Competition, Jun 2021 ~ Oct 2021<br> 
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Shipra Agrawal](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/shipra-agrawal)<br> 
Collaborator: Abhi Gupta, Sian Lee, Luocen Wang 

- Improved the branch-and-bound algorithm by replacing the heuristic branching policy with a sophisticatedly trained graph convolutional neural network model
- Developed a training method in a combination of behavior cloning and parallel evolutionary algorithm
- Designed and built a Singularity container for running and evaluating algorithms on the high-performance computing cluster
