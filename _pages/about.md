I am a M.S. student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Zhejiang University and was a visiting student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. My supervisors at three universities are [Prof. Sharon Di](https://www.civil.columbia.edu/faculty/sharon-di), [Prof. Weifei Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018087/), and [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/), respectively.

## RESEARCH INTEREST
My research interest lies in developing models and algorithms leveraging operations research and machine learning for real-world decision-making problems. Specifically, I regard answering the following question as my academic goal: how to combine operations research and machine learning to design objectives-driven, learning-based approaches that outperform traditional, optimization-driven methods? Overall, my research interests include

**Methodology.** Stochastic and Robust Optimization, Machine Learning

**Application.** Shared Mobility, Transportation, Logistics
