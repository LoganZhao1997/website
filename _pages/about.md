## RESEARCH INTEREST
My research interest lies in developing models and algorithms leveraging operations research and machine learning for real-world decision-making problems. I regard answering the following question as my academic goal: how to design learning-based approaches for large-scale system so that they can outperform traditional, optimization-driven methods? Overall, my research interests include

**Methodology.** Stochastic and Robust Optimization, Cooperative and Competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

**Application.** Shared Mobility, Supply Chain
