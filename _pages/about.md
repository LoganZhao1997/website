I a Ph.D. student in Industrial and System Engineering at the University of Southern California in the 2022 Fall. My research advisor is [Prof. Maged M. Dessouky](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Dessouky/Maged). I received my master's degree at Columbia University in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Zhejiang University and was a visiting student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My previous supervisors were [Prof. Sharon Di](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/sharon-di), [Prof. Weifei Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0018087/), and [Prof. Xin Wang](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Wang_Xin/).

## RESEARCH INTEREST
My research interest lies in developing models and algorithms leveraging operations research and machine learning for sequential decision-making problems in transportation and supply chain management. I regard answering the following question as my academic goal: how to design learning-based approaches for large-scale systems so that they can outperform traditional, optimization-driven methods? Overall, my research interests include

**Methodology.** Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Stochastic Programming, Integer Programming

**Application.** Transportation, Supply Chain Management
