## Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization(https://www.ecole.ai/2021/ml4co-competition/)
NeurIPS 2021 Competition, Jun 2021 ~ Oct 2021

Collaborator: Abhi Gupta

The Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization NeurIPS 2021 competition aims at improving state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization solvers by replacing key heuristic components with machine learning models. The competition's main scientific question is the following: is machine learning a viable option for improving traditional combinatorial optimization solvers on specific problem distributions, when historical data is available ?



## Amazon Last Mile Routing Research Challenge(https://routingchallenge.mit.edu/)
Amazon & MIT, Mar 2021 ~ Jun 2021  
*Advisor*:  [Prof. Sharon Di](https://www.civil.columbia.edu/faculty/sharon-di)

Route optimization problems are very hard problems to solve when dealing with realistically sized problem instances in last-mile delivery. The goal of the Last Mile Routing Research Challenge is to develop innovative approaches leveraging artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and other non-conventional methods to produce solutions to the route sequencing problem which outperform traditional, optimization-driven operations research methods in terms of solution quality and computational cost.
